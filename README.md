# ReactPatterns
This is Britt's fork of the ReactPatterns repository. 

A collection of simple react projects providing reusable components, startup and test examples. Its my react playground.
I am using webpack 2 and babel for the build tool chain.
I have added linting with eslint. The linting rules are in .eslintrc.js.

**React.15**
* Basic
* Basic Isometric/Universal
* GoogleMaps
* Redux Electron
* Redux Fetch ajax
* Redux Pages
  *  Radium
  *  Window Events
  *  Window Object
* Redux SocketIO

**React.Common**
* Button
* DropDowns
* Form Input
* Gallery
* List
* PageIndicator
* ProgressBar
* Sliders
* Tooltip
* TreeViews

# The basics

Open two terminals at the desired project root. I use iTerm on Mac, ConEmu on Windows 10.
First time do "npm install". On the React.15 projects in one terminal "npm run ww".
In the other terminal "npm start".
In your browser localhost:3500. All projects use the same port.
If you want to do it with one terminal session you can run "npm run nw" for no watch.


There is a code viewer running on page 2 of examples at http://jmarkstevens.com/.
